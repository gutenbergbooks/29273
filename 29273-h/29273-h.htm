The Lord has put down

<p>
In the Bible; He says:

<p>
The sin in the world,&#8212;

It grieves him to his heart.

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The Lord he forbiddeth

All cruelty to dumb creatures,

And helpless human too.

He will cut the sinners asunder hereafter.

God says: "Ye shall not afflict any helpless or fatherless child. If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry."

<p>
Human, they cannot get into heaven,
</p>
<p>
Without they do God's commandments, in deeds, words, and thoughts,
</p>
<p>
To human, and dumb creatures too.
</p>
<p>
Consider how you would feel yourselves to be crueled.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The greatest sin is to cruel the poor harmless dumb creatures,
</p>
<p>
They cannot speak, nor help themselves,
</p>
<p>
The next sin is to cruel sick human,
</p>
<p>
The next sin is to cruel any who cannot help themselves.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The Lord give human his word,
</p>
<p>
To do justice to the afflicted and needy,

<p>
To all poor sufferers, human and dumb creatures too,

<p>
To be tender and kind to all.
</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>
O may our sympathizing hearts,

In generous pleasures know,

<p>
Kindly to share in others' joy,

And weep for others' woe.

To all that's good inclined.

The Lord takes pleasure in them,

Have holy hearts, tender and kind.

This world a place of misery,

Some of the worst of sinners have destroyed my head,

Their heart is made of stone, to do such a thing.

O Lord, my God of heaven, I pray for Thy holy spirit to go in all the needy hearts in the whole wide world around. O that they may be tender and kind to all the poor harmless dumb creatures, and sick human too, and others too. The sinners will have their punishment according to their sins, if they will not have the Holy Spirit.

O Lord, my God of heaven, I pray Thee, enable me what to do, and what to say, and what to think, day after day. O Lord, my God, be with me.

Lines composed by Nancy Luce about poor little Tweedle Tedel Beebee Pinky, when she was a little chicken. And you will find more reading in the book about her.
</span>
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
When poor little heart Pinky,
</p>
<p>
Was about six weeks old,
</p>
<p>
She was taken with the chicken distemper,
</p>
<p>
Chickens died off all over this island.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
She was catching grasshoppers, and crickets,
</p>
<p>
In the forenoon smart,
</p>
<p>
At twelve o'clock she was taken sick,
</p>
<p>
And grew worse.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
At one o'clock she was past opening her eyes,
</p>
<p>
And could not stand,
</p>
<p>
Her body felt cold
</p>
<p>
And stiff to my hand.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I give her a portion of epsom salts,
</p>
<p>
With a little black pepper in it,
</p>
<p>
I wept over her that afternoon,
</p>
<p>
I prayed to the Lord to save me her life.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I sat up that night,
</p>
<p>
With her in my lap,
</p>
<p>
Till eleven o'clock that night,
</p>
<p>
Then she seemed to be better.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Then I put her in a thing, a good soft bed,
</p>
<p>
And lay down and spoke to her often,
</p>
<p>
Say how do you do, little dear, she answered me quick,
</p>
<p>
Then I knew she was better.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The next day I gave her
</p>
<p>
Warm water to drink,
</p>
<p>
The third day she was herself,
</p>
<p>
Got well and smart.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
She remained well four years,
</p>
<p>
And laid me pretty eggs,
</p>
<p>
Then the Lord thought best to take her from the evil to come,
</p>
<p>
Without being sick but a very little while.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
When I was raising poor little dear in my lap,
</p>
<p>
And it rained on the window,
</p>
<p>
She would look at the rain,
</p>
<p>
And put her head under my cape.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And take it out every once in a while,
</p>
<p>
And look at the rain,
</p>
<p>
And put it under my cape again,
</p>
<p>
Up most to my shoulder.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Poor cunning little dear,
</p>
<p>
My heart is broken for her,
</p>
<p>
She and I loved each other so well,
</p>
<p>
And she had more than common wit.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
That dear little heart,
</p>
<p>
Remembered four years,
</p>
<p>
Ever since she was a little chicken,
</p>
<p>
I know it by many things.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Her dear friend is left in trouble, and undergo sickness too.
</p>
<p>
Them that knew me once, know&#8212;me&#8212;no&#8212;more,
</p>
<p>
Her death renewed me to seek for God,
</p>
<p>
To land in heaven hereafter.

PRAYER.
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Hear my prayer, O Lord, my God of heaven,
</p>
<p>
Grant me I beseech Thee, O Lord,
</p>
<p>
Send Thy holy spirit into all the needy hearts,
</p>
<p>
In the whole wide world around,
</p>
<p>
Convince them of sin, give them the holy spirit,
</p>
<p>
O that they may be kind and tender
</p>
<p>
To the poor harmless dumb creatures,
</p>
<p>
They cannot speak, nor help themselves,
</p>
<p>
O Lord, prepare the inhabitants of the earth
</p>
<p>
To live in this world and in the world to come.
</p>
<p>
O Lord, I beseech Thee, protect me from committing sin,
</p>
<p>
O Lord, help me to watch and pray,
</p>
<p>
O Lord, I give Thee thanks for what blessings I have,
</p>
<p>
O Lord, can thou deliver me from sickness, trouble and trials?
</p>
<p>
O Lord, stand my friend in this world and in the world to come.
</p>
<p>
O Lord, that the professing inhabitants may not fall back
</p>
<p>
And go to sinning again. O that they may be true Christians,
</p>
<p>
The holy spirit, love and tender kindness for dumb creatures
</p>
<p>
And human too, love God and land in heaven,
</p>
<p>
O Lord, enable me to have the holy spirit all the days of my life,

<p>
O Lord, grant me I beseech Thee,
</p>
<p>
I pray for Thy kingdom to come, to destroy all sin,
</p>
<p>
For the poor harmless dumb creatures,
</p>
<p>
And for sick human too.
</p>
<p>
And for all the troubled in the wide world round,

Human and dumb creatures too,

For thine is the kingdom and the glory forever. Amen.

SICKNESS.
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Sickness distressing, by trouble and trials,
</p>
<p>
Walk, stir, or do a little in the house,
</p>
<p>
It hurts me very bad,
</p>
<p>
And I cannot ride to have comfort.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
My head a misery place all of my time,
</p>
<p>
And part of my time in great misery,
</p>
<p>
And noise sets my head
</p>
<p>
In a dreadful condition.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Most nothing hurts me,
</p>
<p>
And most nothing beats me out,
</p>
<p>
I am dreadful worn down with long sickness,
</p>
<p>
And trials, and sometimes trouble too.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Sick I do feel all my whole time,
</p>
<p>
And misery feelings from head to feet.
</p>
<p>
A number of years,
</p>
<p>
I have undergone great sickness.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Some of my diseases are cured a few years ago,
</p>
<p>
And some of them helped some,
</p>
<p>
And some of them patched along,
</p>
<p>
And some of them not any better at all,
</p>
<p>
But I am dreadful wore down with long sickness.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A common thing in my sickness,
</p>
<p>
Milk my cow, take care of my hens,
</p>
<p>
In such misery, I felt as if I must fall at every step,
</p>
<p>
But I must do it, I must do it.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Oh, Thou who dry'st the mourner's tear,
</p>
<p class="i2">
How dark this world would be.
</p>
<p>
If when deceived and wounded here,
</p>
<p class="i2">
We could not fly to Thee.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
When sore afflictions press me down,
</p>
<p class="i2">
I need thy quickning powers,

Thy word that I have rested on,

<p class="i2">
Shall help my heaviest hours.

POOR LITTLE HEARTS.

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A sketch of two Poor little Banties,
</p>
<p>
They died with old age, over twelve years ago,
</p>
<p>
Poor little Ada Queetie died over thirteen years ago, in 1858.
</p>
<p>
Poor little Beauty Linna died over twelve years ago, in 1859.
</p>
<p>
O my Poor deceased little Ada Queetie,
</p>
<p>
She knew such a sight, and her love and mine,
</p>
<p>
So deep in our hearts for each other,
</p>
<p>
The parting of her and her undergoing sickness and death,
</p>
<p>
O heart rending!
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
She and I could never part,
</p>
<p>
Do consider the night I was left,
</p>
<p>
What I underwent, no tongue could express,
</p>
<p>
Weeping the whole night through.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Poor little Ada Queetie's sickness and death,
</p>
<p>
Destroyed my health at an unknown rate,
</p>
<p>
With my heart breaking and weeping,
</p>
<p>
I kept fire going night after night, to keep Poor little dear warm,
</p>
<p>
I kept getting up nights to see how she was,
</p>
<p>
And see what I could do for her.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Three her last days and nights,
</p>
<p>
She breathed the breath of life here on earth,
</p>
<p>
She was taken down very sick, then I was up all night long,
</p>
<p>
The second night I was up till I was going to fall,
</p>
<p>
Then I fixed her in her box warm, close by the fire,
</p>
<p>
Put warm clothes under, over and around,
</p>
<p>
And left fire burning and lay down, with all my clothes on,
</p>
<p>
A very little while, and got up and up all the time.
</p>
<p>
The third night I touched no bed at all,
</p>
<p>
Poor little heart, she was struck with death at half past eleven o'clock.
</p>
<p>
She died in my arms at twelve o'clock at night, O heart rending!
</p>
<p>
I could been heard to the road, from that time till daylight,
</p>
<p>
No tongue could express my misery of mind.
</p>
<p>
She had more than common wit,
</p>
<p>
And more than common love,
</p>
<p>
Her heart was full of love for me,
</p>
<p>
O do consider my Poor little heart.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
She was my dear and nearest friend, to love and pity me,
</p>
<p>
And to believe that I was sick,
</p>
<p>
She spoke to me, and looked at me most all the time,
</p>
<p>
And could not go from me.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Poor little heart, she used to jump down to the door to go out,
</p>
<p>
She would look around, and call to me to go with her,
</p>
<p>
She found I could not go, she would come in again,
</p>
<p>
She loved her dear friendy so well she could not go out and leave me.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
O my dear beloved little heart, she was my own heart within me,
</p>
<p>
When she was well and I was sick, and made out to sit in my chair,

Poor little Ada Queetie would not keep out of my lap,

Squeezing me close up, talking to me,

My hands around her by the fire, my heart aching,

I took the best of care of her, days and nights,

<p>
I did everything could be done,
</p>
<p>
I did the best I could do,

<p>
I sat up nights with her, till it made me very lame,

<p>
Then I fixed her in her bed, warm, close by the fire,
</p>
<p>
Put warm clothes under, over and around,
</p>
<p>
And left fire burning and lay down with all my clothes on,
</p>
<p>
And got up very often with her, and sat up as long as I could.

I never took off none of my clothes for 18 days and nights.

For eight months after Poor Sissy's decease,

Called me straight back, as soon as I went out.

</div>

I fed her with a teaspoon in her sickness,

Good milk and nutmeg, and good porridge,

Poor little Beauty Linna,

She could not have the wind to blow on her,

All her last summer through,

Deaning me to make fire there for them,

MILK.
</p>
<p>
You needn't talk against milk, if you make your victuals of water, what you put with water won't go half so far, and awful eating and distress ailing folks, and no nourishment to it. Make your victuals of milk, and what you put with milk will go twice as far, and good eating and nourishment to it. Milk is cooling to health, and strengthening, other victuals distress my stomach, because I am out of health; milk agrees with me, other victuals distress me. I cannot eat bread, &#38;c., I must have milk to live on or go without eating till I die.

POOR LITTLE HEART.

HENS&#8212;THEIR DISEASES AND CURE.
</p>
<p>
Human, do understand how to raise up sick hens to health. Some folks do not know how to doctor hens, they doctor them wrong, it hurts them, and it is dreadful cruel to let them die. It is as distressing to dumb creatures to undergo sickness, and death, as it is for human, and as distressing to be crueled, and as distressing to suffer. God requires human to take good care of dumb creatures, and be kind to them, or not keep any. Now do understand, and I will tell you exact.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">
Stoppage in Stomach.</span>&#8212;If a hen has stoppage in her stomach, her corn stops in her crop, hard and swell large, and she sick, first work with your fingers carefully, get it soft, then take a small teaspoon and measure it full of epsom salts, and dissolve it in water, and give it to her with a teaspoon; you must keep to work with your fingers often, to keep it from hardening again, and the next day, if her breath smells bad, there is a rottenness in her stomach, then give her most as much of epsom salts again. Put a little flour porridge in her mouth with a teaspoon, three times a day, and a little soaked cracker, soaked in water; put a little in her mouth if she can swallow it, in five days she eat with the hens and be well. This is the way I cure them. Folks bring hens to me in this disease, to the point of death, been sick a long time, I cure them in five days; they must not have any milk in this disease, it will kill them, do as I tell you and you can cure them. Once in a great while one of my hens have stoppage in their stomach; I cure them with only my fingers, because I take her as soon as the corn stops. Milk does not agree with hens in sickness nor health, it keeps up in their stomach, and they vomit it up. I think strange it does not agree with hens, because milk is so good for human. You must not give your hens any castor oil, nor rhubarb, in not any disease whatever; it is poison for them, my reason tells me so, and I hear of folks killing their hens by giving them such stuff. My hens all keep healthy, because I keep them clean, and keep victuals and clean water standing by them, and take good care of them. I can cure a good many diseases for hens, but I cannot cure every disease. Every once in a while a sick hen is brought to me, to the point of death, been sick a great while, most dead, some ail one disease, some ail a number of diseases; I receive them into my care, I doctor them, and take care of them, I raise them up to health, I am unable to do anything, but I must take pity.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">
Froth in Throat.</span>&#8212;If a hen has froth in her throat and crop, measure a small teaspoonful of epsom salts, dissolve it, put in a little black pepper, and give it to her with a teaspoon, it will cure this disease; but if she make a screaming noise with it, and distressed with it, then a sore growing in her, then no cure.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">
Gapes.</span>&#8212;If a hen or chicken gapes a great deal, and sick, and complains of her throat, make pills of black pepper, cream, white flour, and put a pill in her mouth and make her swallow it till she takes down enough; the black pepper kills the worms. I cure them so.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">
Bag Stone.</span>&#8212;This is a seldom case, I have known this case once in a while. If a hen has a bag of stones grow in her, hang down under her, you must give her the best of good cake to eat, the stones will consume in a few weeks, then she will eat corn and oats with the hens, and lay you eggs; but if you do not give her the best of cake she will certainly die, she cannot eat anything else then, in this disease, but best of cake. I cured them so.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">
Skin in Hen.</span>&#8212;If a hen goes on her nest, and try to lay an egg, and cannot, and there most all day, then a skin of an egg is in her, she will certainly die if the skin of egg is not took out of her; some one has a small finger, and common sense, take the skin of egg out of her, then she is all right. I cure them so.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">
Bones.</span>&#8212;If a hen is wounded in her hips, or any of her bones, bathe freely with McQuesten's Extractor a number of times every day, put on a good deal, till she gets well; I have cured a number of hens with this Extractor, they could not stand nor walk, their bones was so spraint, and so wrenched, &#38;c. If their bones stiff too, then put on Dr. Job Sweet's Sprain Liniment, if any sore, then put on castile soap. I cure them so.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">
Wild.</span>&#8212;I bought a young hen last year, she was dreadful wild, and when one week was at an end she came to me, and let me take her up, she keep still, and eat out of my hand, she remains gentle ever since, and a good hen to lay eggs.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">
Green.</span>&#8212;If a hen has bright green come from her, look same as bright green paint, with yellow in it, give her rice water with nutmeg grated in it, and Jamaica ginger, a number of times a day, till it cures this disease. I cure them in a few days.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">
Feeling.</span>&#8212;It is your duty to take good care, and not let anything hurt your hens, consider dear little hens.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">
Birds.</span>&#8212;When I step down to the door, the little harmless birds come fly down on the ground, only one yard off my feet, and some of them half a yard off my feet. I give them oats and dough to eat; they eat it. Will they come to any one else? so few folks have feeling.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">
Diarrh&#339;a.</span>&#8212;-If a hen has diarrh&#339;a, and pain with it, you must be as careful about what she eats, as her medicines; she must not have not any corn, and not any corn meal dough, not till she is well. Give her a little warm flour porridge, five times a day, with a teaspoon; her medicine, Jamaica ginger, put in warm rice water, and grate in good deal nutmeg, give it to her three times a day, take good care of her, and she get well. I cure them so.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">
Lice.</span>&#8212;Human, some of them, have lice on their hens, it is cruel, the reason is, the hen-house above the ground, and keep dirty, that breeds lice on hens, and breeds diseases too; have a cellar for your hens, and take up the dressing every morning, be no lice, lice will not breed in a cellar, I never have any lice on my hens, and they keep healthy. Folks bring sick hens to me, I cure them, and lice on them too, I put black pepper in their feathers, it kills the lice. God meant for human to take good care of dumb creatures, and be kind to them, or not keep any. Do by dumb creatures as you would wish to be done by if you was dumb creatures, consider how you would feel.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">
Cows.</span>&#8212;Meal is good for cows, but it will not do for her to have it dry, it gets in her nose and lungs, and hurt her, wet it; the best way is to scald it, and cool it, does more good. Cracked corn is better; boil it, put on cover, it steams it soft very soon, one quart makes two and a half. Cows must not have dusty hay, it hurts their lungs, &#38;c. Cows ought not to have Timothy herds grass hay, it is physic. Hay ought to be wet.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">
Warped Neck.</span>&#8212;If a hen has warped neck, rub on castor oil, faithful, a number of times, and give her a little Huile D'olive to take inside, a good chance, her neck come in place again.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">
Swelled Head.</span>&#8212;If a hen has swelled head and face, and blue black, put on Huile D'olive, I had one so, I cured her.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">
Fever.</span>&#8212;If a hen has a fever, and her crop swelled soft, take a small teaspoon full of epsom salts and dissolve it in warm water, and put in a little black pepper in it, and give it to her with a teaspoon, and give her as much warm water as she wants to drink in her sickness, I cure hens and chickens so in three days, and give her a little porridge with a teaspoon, five times a day, till she is able to eat. I cure them so.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">
Feeling.</span>&#8212;If any one is cruel to dumb creatures, they will go to everlasting punishment, and have the greatest punishment.
</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">
Sick</span>, I am, and very unable to do anything, but I must take pity,&#8212;dear little hens.
</p>
<hr class="short">
<p>
God is good, love and truth, merciful in all his ways. If the will of God could be done in full, it would be a great happiness among dumb creatures and human too. Cruelty is of the evil one. The good God is looking down upon such folks; He will cast them off to everlasting punishment. Human must do God's commandments in deeds, words and thoughts. Be kind to poor hens in every way, and not let them suffer with hunger nor cold; cruelty not in any way; must not affrighten them; doctor them when they have diseases. Be good and kind to them. Think how good God is. Act up to His will in all your ways and all your thoughts too. You must keep your hens from suffering with cold, and give them enough to eat, and keep them clean, and not affrighten them, &#38;c., &#38;c., or they cannot lay you eggs. If your hens or chickens have their crops swelled soft, and a fever, give them a portion of Epsom salts, with a little black pepper in it, and give them as much warm water as they can drink; in their sickness take good care of them, they get well. If they have stoppage in their stomach, their crop swelled hard, take your fingers and jam carefully till their crop is soft, then give them a portion of Epsom salts. I have cured them with only my fingers, they get well. If they have itching feet and scurfy, if mutton tallow will not cure it, then put their feet in a thing of warm water and wash them every morning till they get well. When they shed their feathers, their stomach is weak then, they must have soft victuals then, hard corn will distress their stomach then. If hen's body comes out, put it back in her and see to her, she be well by the next day. If it comes more than half way out, it can be put back if any one has common sense. If a string of hen's insides comes out, with a egg fast to it, break the egg, and take it off from her insides and put her insides back in her and see to her, she be well by the next day. If hen's legs chilled with cold for want of sun, and they cannot walk, take them by the fire and rub their legs and feet, faithful, half a day, then rub on black pepper mixed with warm water, they get well. If a hen is starved she must not have hard corn at first, give her flour bread soaked soft in milk, till she is able to eat corn. Hens must not go in snow, it hurts them. They must not have fat meat. They must not be crowded, their room must be large enough. Their roosts must not be too high, for them to fly down on hard floor, it hurts their feet and hips. I know it. Hens want sun in winter and shade in summer. If hens' feet crack, bleed, and sore places, melt mutton tallow and white sugar together, rub it on faithful, they get well. If they bleed great deal, put on warm alum water first, they get well. If hens' feet swell, put on sweet apple balsam every day, they get well. If hens' head turns over, give her Epsom salts and black pepper, she get over it for a while. If hens have diarrh&#339;a, give them boiled rice, black pepper, nutmeg, mixed, they get well if you take good care of them. Hens must not have fish, it physics them. Hens must not have anything relaxing. If hens have rattling in their throat give them Epsom salts and black pepper, they get well. If hen has her head quiver, and stagger, give her Epsom salts, and keep her quiet, and her food soak cracker in milk, she get well. If hens taken lame in the afternoon without being hurt, rub on mutton tallow and black pepper, they get well. If hen's bones spraint or bruised, bathe freely with Mequesten's Extracter, take good care of her, she get well in time, must have little time for it. This medicine will cure burns, scalds, on human, no doubt on hens too. It will cure sores, put it on when they first begin to come. If anything ails hens' eyes, rain-water is good, new milk put on, mutton tallow put around her eyes, salve made of rose water and cream, put around her eyes. Hens must not be confined in wind, it hurts them, they cannot lay you eggs. God placed us in this world to be kind to dumb creatures, or not keep any, and kind to human too. Consider what a wickedness it is to go contrary from it. I keep cow and hens, I do my duty for them. If hens have watery stomachs give them black pepper, put it in their dough, if they are able to eat it, if not able, then mix the pepper with water, and give it to her with a teaspoon, be careful and not have it too strong, to take her breath. If hens have pip, give them the same medicine, it will cure pip and watery stomach. Help them in season. If hen has swelled throat, put on sweet oil and black pepper, she get well. You must not give your hens salt, it will kill them. You must not give them rye, it will hurt them. If hen lays soft shell eggs, let her set two or three weeks, she lay hard shell eggs again. You must take good care of your poor hens or they cannot lay you eggs. Hens must be kept clean and must not have any bad smell with them, it will poison them. You must not give them cayenne pepper, it will poison them, it drives a redness into their heads, then they fail till they die. Black pepper is good for them when they need it. Hens must have clean victuals and clean water to drink. Take the chill off the water in winter. Keep good yellow southern corn standing by them, they take a little when they want it, it does them more good, and it takes less to keep them. Give them boiled oats, it is good for them to lay eggs. I give my hens boiled oats all the time, and corn standing by them. I give them some other victuals too, sometimes, and sometimes I give them some boiled potatoes. I mash it with cream for them. My hens lay me more eggs than anybody's hens anywhere, by what I hear. Good flour bread is splendid to make them lay eggs, but I am not able to cook it for them. The bread must not be sour. Keep fine clam shells by them, and gravel sand. They must be kept warm in winter and cool in summer. They must have clean, warm cellar room, you will have double the eggs. Take up the dressing every morning certain, and oftener, if they stay down there days. When cold, keep them in the cellar, when the weather is suitable, let them out days. If cold morning, keep them in till the sun gets up warm. Be clever to them. They must not be affrighted. They can never get over it. I hear what folks do all my days, and their poor hens cannot lay much and they die off. It is wicked for folks to be so cruel.

<p>
My hens are all in better order since I had a cellar for them, than they were before, and lay me double the eggs. Hens must not suffer with the cold, nor no other sufferings, you cannot have eggs. Raise your chickens on good flour bread, it will make them healthy, grow fast and smart; they must be fed often; I do not think meal is very good for hens or chickens; meal is splendid for cows. If you are forced to give your hens or chickens meal, you must sift it fine and scald it and cool it. I used to raise my chickens on flour middlings dough, it is splendid for them. Flour bread is better. I do not set any hens now. You must not let young chickens go in cold nor wet ground, nor rain, &#38;c., &#38;c. You must boil some corn in winter, and give it to your hens warm, besides other victuals.

<p>
Human, those that are cruel to dumb creatures and to human too, and murder, rob, steal, cheat, contrary, spite, deceit, and take the advantage of any one, to damage them in any way, &#38;c., &#38;c., those will go to everlasting punishment hereafter, and have the greatest punishment.
